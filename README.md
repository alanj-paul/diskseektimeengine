SEEKTIME ENGINE is an interactive web-based Disk Scheduling Algorithm Simulator.
It visually demonstrates how different disk scheduling algorithms move the disk head and calculates the total and average seek time.

The project is built using:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Chart.js (for visualization)

It allows users to simulate and compare:
1.FCFS
2.SSTF
3.SCAN
4.C-SCAN
5.LOOK
6.C-LOOK

Features:-
1.Interactive input for disk requests
2.Adjustable maximum track number
3.Custom head position
4.Direction selection (Left / Right)
5.Adjustable animation speed
6.Live animated head movement graph
7.Seek Time and Average Seek Time calculation
8.Algorithm comparison using bar graph
9.Automatic best algorithm detection
10.Strict input validation

Outputs Provided:=
1.Seek Time
2.Average Seek Time
3.Total Head Movements
4.Best Performing Algorithm
5.Graphical Visualization of Head Movement
6.Comparison Graph of All Algorithms

How to Run:=
1.Download or clone the repository.
2.Make sure all files are in the same folder
        index.html
        style.css
        script.js
3.Open index.html in any modern web browser.
4.No installation required.
